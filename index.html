    <h3> Research </h3>
    <p> I do not yet have a well-defined field of research. In the past, I have worked with optimal transport theory, autoencoders of various flavours, multi-modal language models, and manifold separability. I am also interested in, though generally uneducated about, homological alebgra, martingales and stochastic calculus, and exotic structures. </p>
    
    <h3> Writing </h3>
    <p> On occasion, I write on things ancient and abstract. Particular interests are Thucydides, Plato, Heraclitus, Pindar, and Archimedes. I also have some speculative work on metaethics, metaphysics, and a hyper-functionalist theory of self, </p>
