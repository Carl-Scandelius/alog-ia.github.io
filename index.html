    <h3> Research </h3>
    <p> I do not yet have a well-defined cone of research. In the past, I have worked with optimal transport theory and metric learning. I am currently working on sparse autoencoding/overcomplete dictionary learning for mechanistic interpretability, primarily of transformer-based language models. </p>
      
    <h3> Writing </h3>
    <p> On occasion, I write on things ancient and abstract. Particular interests are Thucydides, Plato, Heraclitus, Pindar, and Archimedes. I also have some speculative work on metaethics, metaphysics, and a hyper-functionalist theory of self. </p>
